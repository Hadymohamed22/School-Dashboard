# School Dashboard 🏫

Hey guys! This project is a simple school dashboard I created using React. I built it as a practice project to improve my skills in building interactive UIs and handling dashboard layouts.

The design includes key sections you’d find in a typical school management panel — like students, teachers, statistics, and general layout structure. I got inspired by various UI dashboards and decided to bring it to life using React and modern tools.
